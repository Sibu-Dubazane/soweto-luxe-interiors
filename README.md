# Soweto Luxe Interiors

## Development and Deployment Workflow

- **main** branch: Live production site
- **dev** branch: Development and testing branch
- Separate **staging repo** for safe testing with GitHub Pages enabled on `dev` branch

## How to use

1. Work on `dev` branch locally.
2. Push changes to both origin/dev and staging/dev remotes.
3. Test changes live on staging site:  
https://sibu-dubazane.github.io/soweto-luxe-interiors-staging/
4. When stable, merge `dev` into `main` to deploy to live site.
